# Connect Four

This Ruby code was created to satisfy an assignment from [The Odin Project](http://www,theodinproject.com).

## What Does It Do?

Connect Four is a board game for two players. The board has a seven rows and six columns. Each player takes turns stacking their colored tokens into the bottom-most position of each of the six columns. The first player to stack four tokens in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins! This command-line game is exactly that.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, clone this repo with the command line and then run RSpec
```
$ rspec
```
If all tests are green, run the game:
```
$ ruby connect_four.rb
```
